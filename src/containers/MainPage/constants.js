  'The Basics Project Foundation is a not-for-profit, community-led volunteer group that focuses on providing tangible relief materials to under-resourced communities in our society. Our main aim is to empower and uplift individuals and families by adopting a holistic approach that targets the basic needs of these individuals at the grassroots level; these include nutrition, education, sanitary health, mental health, and menstrual health. The Basics Project Foundation intends to provide people with rationed food supplies and hygienically cooked meals to meet their daily dietary requirements. We aim to conduct awareness and capacity-building workshops related to menstrual and mental health amongst these communities and provide them with resources like sanitary napkins, etc. We also aim to provide stationery items to children and organise awareness campaigns to spread information regarding the importance of education among children. We strongly believe that, with the help of relief aid, we can empower people to scout for jobs lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Basics Project Foundation organises drives in various parts of Delhi-NCR through crowdfunding and collaborative associations.',
